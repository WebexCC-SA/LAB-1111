## Customer scenario
![Pixel Pals Studios Logo](template_assets/PixelPalsHorizontal.png)

<b>Company Name:</b> Pixel Pals Studios
<b>Industry:</b> Video Game Development
Creates colorful, family-friendly video and mobile games

<b>Employees:</b> Full-time game designers, artists, marketing, administrative and IT 
Anita Perez, Charles Holland, Rebekah Barretta, Ricardo Filice, Taylor Bard

<b>Contractors:</b> Freelance voice actors, musicians, and independent testers hired for specific game launches
Kellie Melby, Eric Steele, Stefan Mauk

In this lab, you’ll simulate a real-world organization, Pixel Pals Studios, that employs both full-time employees and external contractors. To maintain security and productivity, the IT admin needs to ensure that full-time employees have access to the full range of Webex Suite features, while contractors are assigned a more restricted set of tools to minimize security risks and unnecessary access.
