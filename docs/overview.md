In this lab, you’ll simulate a real-world organization, Pixel Pals Studios, that employs both full-time employees and external contractors. To maintain security and productivity, the IT admin needs to ensure that full-time employees have access to the full range of Webex Suite features, while contractors are assigned a more restricted set of tools to minimize security risks and unnecessary access.
