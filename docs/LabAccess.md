### Using this guide

  <li>The labs are listed in the left navigation bar in the order they should be completed.</li>
  <li>You can also navigate between labs using the <strong>Previous</strong> and <strong>Next</strong> options at the bottom of each page.</li>
  <li>Most labs are structured with two columns:
    <ul>
      <li>One column presents a business use case or problem and the solution using Webex features.</li>
      <li>The other column provides detailed instructions on configuring settings in Control Hub or User Hub.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Look for hints and tips throughout the labs, which are displayed in <em>italics</em>.</li>
  <li>Please note, if you work ahead, questions cannot be answered until the group reaches that topic.</li>
</ul>
