>![Think About It](template_assets/thinkingcat.png)**Consider the workspaces and devices in your organization**<br>

- Where are the devices physically located?<br>
    - Campus, building, floors<br>
- How are the spaces used?<br>
    - Meetings rooms, open areas, huddle rooms, kiosks<br>
- How many people typically occupy those spaces?<br>
- What is each space’s capacity, and how does it affect device placement and use?<br>
- How will the devices support collaboration and user needs in each environment?<br>
